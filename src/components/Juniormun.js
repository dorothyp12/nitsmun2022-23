        With great pride and honour, we announced the first edition of NITS Junior MUN exclusively for school students. We believe that children and young teens should be exposed to the various intricacies of society and nations and should understand how the world functions from the grassroot level along with the challenges faced. It is only with proper grooming, experience and exposure that enables them to make changes in the society. Through this conference, we targeted students from grade VI to grade XII from schools all across the country.
        <br/> <br/>
        A day-long free-of-cost workshop was held a few days before the conference in order to acclimatise those without prior experience. Keeping in mind the various examination schedules of the Central and State Boards, we organised our conference from October 16, 2021 to October 17, 2021.
